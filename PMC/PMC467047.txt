Objective

This study aims to explore the impact of Nesfatin-1 on type 2 diabetic erectile dysfunction (T2DMED) and its underlying mechanism in regulating the phenotypic switching of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCSMCs).

Methods

Twenty-four 4-week-old male C57 wild-type mice were randomly assigned to the control group, model group, and Nesfatin-1 treatment group. Monitoring included body weight, blood glucose levels, and penile cavernous pressure (ICP). Histochemistry and Western blot analyses were conducted to assess the expressions of α-SMA, OPN, and factors related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. CCSMCs were categorized into the control group, high glucose and high oleic acid group (GO group), Nesfatin-1 treatment group (GO + N group), sildenafil positive control group (GO + S group), and PI3K inhibitor group (GO + N + E group). Changes in phenotypic markers, cell morphology, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway were observed in each group.

Results

(1) Nesfatin-1 significantly ameliorated the body size, body weight, blood glucose, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance in T2DMED mice. (2) Following Nesfatin-1 treatment, the ICP/MSBP ratio and the peak of the ICP curve demonstrated a significant increase. (3) Nesfatin-1 significantly enhanced smooth muscle and reduced collagen fibers in the corpus cavernosum. (4) Nesfatin-1 notably increased α-SMA expression and decreased OPN expression in CCSMCs. (5) Nesfatin-1 elevated PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR levels in penile cavernous tissue.

Conclusions

Nesfatin-1 not only effectively improves body weight and blood glucose levels in diabetic mice but also enhances erectile function and regulates the phenotypic switching of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. The potential mechanism involves Nesfatin-1 activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to induce the conversion of CCSMCs to a contractile phenotype.

pmc1 Introduction

With the improvement of living standards, the incidence of type 2 diabetes is gradually increasing. It is estimated that by 2045, there will be around 700 million people living with diabetes globally [1]. In a representative sample of Chinese adults, the prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 11.6 %, and the prevalence of prediabetes was 50.1 % [2]. These evidences indicate that diabetes mellitus has become an important public health problem. The complications of diabetes mellitus (DM) have always been a serious health problem. Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes include microangiopathy, neuropathy, and sexual dysfunction (SD). Erectile dysfunction (ED) has long been regarded as the most important male sexual dysfunction. A cross-sectional study of 372 men showed a significant correlation between diabetes and erectile dysfunction, and it was extremely common in the diabetic population [3]. In recent years, with the improvement of living standards, the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus erectile dysfunction has increased, which seriously affecting people's quality of life [2]. At the same time, the current treatment of T2DMED mainly relies on strict diet and effective drug control of blood glucose, correction of dyslipidemia and control of hypertension, at the same time oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and penile cavernous drug injection therapy are required to achieve a certain effect.Currently, there is a lack of drugs that can simultaneously control blood glucose and improve erectile dysfunction [4]. The precise mechanism underlying erectile dysfunction resulting from type 2 diabetes remains unclear. This lack of clarity is also responsible for the limited efficacy observed when simply administering drugs to manage blood glucose and address erectile dysfunction in clinical settings.

The American Association of Urological Surgeons guidelines define erectile dysfunction as a persistent or recurring condition in which the penis is unable to erect and/or maintain an erection to complete satisfactory sexual intercourse [5]. It is one of the most common multifactorial diseases of the male reproductive system in male sexual dysfunction. Penile erection mainly depends on dilating the cavernous artery and cavernous sinus.The contraction and relaxation of CCSMs determine the expansion of the cavernous sinus and penile erection. Therefore, maintaining the normal function of corpus cavernosal smooth muscle plays a crucial role in improving penile erection and the treatment of T2DMED. Studies have shown that the smooth muscle phenotype is an important factor in maintaining the function and structure of smooth muscle, and regulating the phenotype of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle to the contractile type can improve the occurrence of ED [6]. At present, a large number of literature confirmed hypoxia [[7], [8], [9]], platelet-derived growth factor [10], chronic prostatitis [11], tobacco harmful gas [12], and other external factors may lead to the transition of CCSMs phenotype to synthetic phenotype, and then lead to ED. Diabetes hyperglycemia is also an important factor leading to smooth muscle phenotype switching [13], however, it is rarely reported in T2DMED.

Nesfatin-1 is a newly discovered secretory peptide found in the hypothalamus, brain stem, and gastrointestinal tract. It is a hydrolytic fragment of the nuclear group of protein 2 (NUCB2). In recent years, as research on diabetes-related complications has advanced, the role of Nesfatin-1 as a novel peptide molecule has gained widespread recognition. It has been acknowledged for its ability to enhance glucose metabolism, reduce blood glucose levels, regulate cardiovascular function, and consequently, ameliorate diabetes complications along with associated structural and functional abnormalities in organs [14]. Current studies have confirmed that Nesfatin-1 can improve diabetic cardiomyopathy [15], diabetic nephropathy [16], diabetic retinopathy [17], diabetic polycystic ovary syndrome [18,19] and other diseases, which is considered as one of the important potential target drugs for the treatment of diabetes-related complications [20](Prinz and Stengel, 2016).However, there have been no reports on whether Nesfatin-1 can improve Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Erectile Dysfunction (T2DMED) and its specific mechanism. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the potential of Nesfatin-1 to improve T2DMED and elucidate its mechanism by examining the regulation of Nesfatin-1 on the phenotype switching of cavernous smooth muscle cells. The objective is to offer new insights for the clinical treatment of T2DMED.

After 16 weeks of high-fat feeding, the mice became fatter, weight increased significantly, and fasting blood glucose increased.The results of oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that blood glucose was significantly higher than that of normal control group at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min. Exogenous give Nesfatin-1 4 weeks after treatment, the body weight of the mice was significantly lower than that of the model group (P = 0.0001), and the blood glucose, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance of the mice were significantly improved (Fig. 1a-c) (Body mass: Control group: pre-treatment 52.88 ± 1.1g,post-treatment 31.56 ± 1.6g; Model group: pre-treatment 48.4 ± 2.2g,post-treatment 57.00 ± 2.2g; Nesfatin-1 group: pre-treatment 49.7 ± 1.2g,post-treatment 41.1 ± 2.2g. Fasting blood glucose: Control group:5.0 ± 0.5; Model group:9.4 ± 1.5; Nesfatin-1 group:5.7 ± 0.2). Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels compared with model group significantly reduced (Control group: 4.9μ±1.4 mol/ml; Model group: 11.1μ±3.1 mol/ml; Nesfatin-1 group: 3.2μ±0.5 mol/ml). OGTT and TII results of mice treated with Nesfatin-1 were significantly improved.The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that blood glucose levels were significantly higher at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min compared to the control group. After 4 weeks of Nesfatin-1 treatment, the OGTT and ITT results in the treatment group significantly decreased (Fig. 1d-e), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Additionally, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after Nesfatin-1 treatment was significantly lower than the model group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1c) (Control group: 4.9μ±1.4 mol/ml; Model group: 11.1μ±3.1 mol/ml; Nesfatin-1 group: 3.2μ±0.5 mol/ml). with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).Fig. 1 Changes in metabolism-related indicators in mice.

5.2 2.T2DMED mice, subjected to a high-fat diet for 16 weeks, exhibited the development of erectile dysfunction. Notably, the exogenous administration of Nesfatin-1 significantly ameliorated erectile dysfunction in T2DMED mice

The peak value of the ICP curve in normal mice was 155 ± 13.1cmH2O, and the mean value of ICP/MSBP was 0.90 ± 0.05, while the peak value of ICP curve in T2DMED mice was significantly reduced to 80 ± 22cmH2O, and the mean value of ICP/MSBP was 0.49 ± 0.13. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After Nesfatin-1 treatment, the peak value of ICP curve in mice increased significantly and the ICP curve became steeper (Fig. 2a). The average peak value of the curve was 154.4 ± 16.1cmH2O, and As the average of ICP/MSBP was 0.9 ± 0.04. Further statistical comparison of ICP/MSBP showed statistical differences among the three group (Fig. 2b) (P < 0.05).Fig. 2 The changes of erectile function in mice. a.ICP curves in mice. b.Changes in the ratio of ICP/MSBP of mice in each group.

5.3 3.Nesfatin-1 increases the smooth muscle content of T2DMED mice

Masson staining was used to observe the changes of in smooth muscle and collagen fibers in the corpus cavernosum. We found that the smooth muscle fibers in T2DMED mice were significantly less than those in the control group, and the content of collagen fibers was significantly increased. After 4 weeks of Nesfatin-1 treatment, the smooth muscle increased and the collagen fibers decreased (Fig. 3a-b), with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).Fig. 3 The content of smooth muscle fibers and collagen in mice. a.Masson staining results in each group of mice.

5.4 4.Nesfatin-1 regulates the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle phenotype in T2DMED mice

Immunohistochemistry showed that α-SMA, a marker of smooth muscle contraction phenotype, significantly decreased in T2DMED mice and increased significantly after Nesfatin-1 treatment. However, the synthetic phenotypic marker OPN was significantly increased in the model group and decreased significantly by Nesfatin-1 treatment (Fig. 4a-b). Further quantitative analysis of α-SMA and OPN by Western blot showed that the change trend was consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4c-d).Fig. 4 The expression of phenotypic markers in mice.

5.5 5.Nesfatin-1 regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway

The protein level PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in the penile cavernous tissue of mice was remarkably decreased in T2DMED (P < 0.05). Compared to the model group, the level of PI3K, p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in penile cavernous tissue was remarkably increased in the treatment group (P < 0.05). Western blot results and quantitative analysis of gray values of bands showed that the PI3K was inhibited in T2DMED mice, and the phosphorylation levels of its downstream factors AKT and mTOR were also significantly decreased, but the total AKT and mTOR did not change. After Nesfatin-1 treatment, PI3K was significantly activated in the treatment group, and its downstream p-Akt and p-mtor were also significantly increased (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in the total AKT and mTOR levels (Fig. 5a-b).Fig. 5 Effect of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway on phenotypic switching of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. a.The level of PI3K,p-AKT,AKT, p-mTOR and mTOR in the penile cavernous tissue of mice was determined by Western blot. b.Quantitative analysis of PI3K,p-AKT,AKT, p-mTOR and mTOR in each group (n = 4 per group *P＜0.05).

5.6 6.The cell model was established through co-culture with high glucose and high oleic acid. Sildenafil, Nesfatin-1, and Esculetin were administered to observe their effects on the morphology and quantity of CCSMCs

CCSMCs were detected by CCK-8 experiment according to the corresponding drug concentration gradient and time gradient, and the corresponding optical density (OD) value of each hole measured at 450 nm was determined. The results showed that the concentration of Acid oil was 20 mM; The concentration of Nesfatin-1 at 150 ng/mL; Esculetin at 40 μM and treated separately for 48 h had the greatest effect on OD values (Fig. 6a). Therefore, we selected the drug concentration and treatment time for subsequent experiments.Fig. 6 CCK-8 results of oleic acid, nesfatin-1 and Esculetin and micrographs of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells in each group after treatment.

Fig. 6

CCSMCs were divided into groups according to the drug concentration and treatment time selected by CCK-8 assay, and pictures of each group were taken by inverted microscope camera system. CCSMCs treated with high glucose and high oleic acid were round in shape and decreased in number. After Nesfatin-1 and Sildenafi treatment, most of the cells returned to spindle shape and their number increased significantly. There was no significant difference in cell morphology and number between Nesfatin-1 and Sildenafi treatment groups. However, after treatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitor Esculetin, the morphology of CCSMCs returned to the main round shape and the number of CCSMCS decreased significantly (Fig. 6b).

5.7 7.Through in vitro cell experiments, it has been confirmed that Nesfatin-1 regulates the transformation of CCSMCs into a contractile type, with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway playing a crucial role in this process

Immunofluorescence indicated that α-SMA expression decreased significantly in GO group, while OPN expression increased significantly and its shape changed from spindle to round. After Nesfatin-1 and Sildenafi treatment, α-SMA increased significantly, OPN decreased significantly, and cell morphology returned to a spindle shape. However, α-SMA expression was not significantly increased and OPN expression was not significantly decreased in the GO + N + E group, showing a trend similar to that in the GO group (Fig. 7a-b). We quantitatively analyzed α-SMA and OPN of cells in each group by Western blot, and the change trend was consistent with the immunofluorescence results (Fig. 7c-d). We quantitatively analyzed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway expression of CCSMCs in each group by Western blot. The results indicated that the expressions of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR were significantly increased in CCSMCs treated after Nesfatin-1 and Sildenafi treatment (P < 0.05). However, the expressions of p-AKT/AKT and p-mTOR/mTOR in the GO + N + E group were significantly decreased compared with those in GO + N and GO + S groups (P < 0.05), showing a trend similar to that in the GO group (Fig. 7e-f).Fig. 7 The expression changes of CCSMCs phenotypic markers and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

6 Discussion

Currently, more than half of diabetes patients worldwide are suffering from ED, and diabetes is gradually recognized as an important cause of ED [21,22]. The clinical treatment of diabetes-related erectile dysfunction mainly relies on basic therapies such as dietary control, hypoglycemic medication, combined with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (tadalafil/sildenafil, etc.) and penile cavernosal injection to improve erectile dysfunction However, in clinical treatment, there are still a considerable number of patients who do not respond well to these medications [23], and the lack of both can improve diabetes and can improve ED drugs. At present, the specific mechanism of erectile dysfunction caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear, which is also the reason the poor effect of simply drugs to control blood glucose and treating erectile dysfunction with drugs is not satisfactory in clinical practice.Therefore, it is urgent to explore the mechanism of T2DMED, explore new drugs and new targets for improving T2DMED, and provide a new treatment idea for T2DMED patients.We found that the body weight, blood glucose, insulin resistance and erectile function of the treated mice were significantly decreased, and the expression of contractile phenotypic marker α-SMA was increased, while the synthetic phenotypic marker OPN was decreased, the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle fibers were increased, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated.We established an in vitro model of spongy smooth muscle cultured with high oleic acid and high glucose and treated it with Nesfatin 1. We found that the CCSMCs phenotype changed to contractile after treatment, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was activated. After we added Esculetin to inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, the expression of α-SMA was significantly decreased and the expression of OPN was increased in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells. The effect of Nesfatin-1 on improving the phenotype switching of CCSMCs was significantly inhibited, which further demonstrated that Nesfatin-1 regulated the phenotype switching of CCSMCS through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

Some studies have reported the use of the streptozotocin (STZ) injection method to induce diabetic erectile dysfunction in animal models, where the destruction of pancreatic islet cells leads to diabetes [[24], [25], [26]]. However, this approach does not align with the clinical epidemiological characteristics, given that type 2 diabetes mellitus is more prevalent in practical medical settings.In our research, we adopted a well-recognized modeling technique by continuously feeding mice with a high-fat diet for 16 weeks to establish a mouse model that closely mimics the disease characteristics and metabolic status of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Evaluation of relevant indicators of glucose metabolism in the model group revealed a significant increase in body weight, body type, and blood glucose values compared to the control group, showing statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).Subsequently, we measured the ICP in the mice. The ICP of the mice in the model group decreased, manifesting the typical characteristics of the T2DMED model. This outcome indicated that mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus induced solely by a high-fat diet would exhibit an erectile dysfunction phenotype, affirming the successful establishment of the T2DMED model.

We delved deeper into understanding the mechanism behind T2DMED. The phenotypes of CCSMCs can be categorized into contractile and synthetic types. Contractile CCSMCs exhibit considerable plasticity, allowing them to undergo phenotypic regulation from a contractile state to a synthetic state in response to local environmental stimul [27]. The characteristic of smooth muscle cell transition to the synthetic phenotype is an increase in expressions of extracellular matrix and type I collagen, while the expressions of contractile cytoskeletal proteins (such as α-SMA, SM22α, etc.) decrease and the expressions of synthetic cytoskeletal proteins (such as OPN, tenascin-C, etc) [28]. The main component of contractile smooth muscle cells is myofilament, which is an important factor in maintaining smooth muscle contraction function. The synthetic phenotype has a strong ability to synthesize extracellular matrix, manifesting as excessive proliferation and fibrosis of smooth muscle cells, which can cause contractile dysfunction.Our study found that type 2 diabetes mellitus leads to a significant reduction of α-SMA and a significant increase of OPN in corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells, which is consistent with the transformation of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells into synthetic cells, which may be the mechanism of type 2 diabetes mellitus leading to ED.

In recent years, the significant role of Nesfatin-1 in regulating blood glucose and improving diabetes-related complications has been widely reported [29]. Previous studies have found that Nesfatin-1 can improve obesity-related type 2 diabetes and ameliorate atherosclerosis in the cardiovascular system [30].

Therefore, we hypothesize that Nesfatin-1 may not only improve type 2 diabetes but also alleviate T2DMED. Thus, we attempted to investigate the role of Nesfatin-1 in improving T2DMED and its specific mechanism using the T2DMED mouse model. Through exogenous administration of Nesfatin-1 to the model mice, we observed significant reductions in blood sugar, body weight, and body size, as well as significant improvements in insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. This means that Nesfatin-1 effectively corrected the metabolic disorder in the mice. Even more surprisingly, we found a significant improvement in erectile dysfunction in mice treated with Nesfatin-1, confirming the potential of Nesfatin-1 as a therapeutic option for T2DMED.

In further mechanistic exploration, our investigation revealed that Nesfatin-1 treatment in T2DMED mice resulted in an increase in the number of smooth muscle fibers, a significant upregulation in the expression of the contractile phenotype marker, and a substantial improvement in the contractility of the penile cavernosum. These findings suggest that Nesfatin-1 has the capacity to reduce α-SMA and increase OPN, inducing a transformation in the synthetic phenotype of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle towards the contractile phenotype. Consequently, this restoration of the normal contractile function of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle is indicative of the therapeutic potential of Nesfatin-1 in T2DMED.

To validate our findings, we conducted in vitro cell experiments. We cultured cavernous smooth muscle cells in a high-glucose and high-oleic acid environment to simulate the microenvironment of diabetic metabolic disorder. Our observations revealed that corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells exhibited a synthetic phenotype consistent with those from type 2 diabetic mice when exposed to a culture environment with high oleic acid and high glucose. After Nesfatin-1 intervention, there was a transformation from a synthetic to a contractile type.

Upon further exploration of the mechanism, we observed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway was significantly inhibited. In spongy smooth muscle cells cultured with high oleic acid and high glucose,α-SMA expression was significantly decreased, and OPN expression was significantly increased. Following Nesfatin-1 treatment, p-AKT and p-mTOR significantly increased, activating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Simultaneously, α-SMA expression significantly increased, and OPN expression significantly decreased.

To further confirm the role of the signaling pathway, we introduced Esculetin to Nesfatin-1 treated cells to directly inhibit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. We found that Nesfatin-1 significantly inhibited the improvement of phenotype switching in cavernous smooth muscle cells. This further substantiates that Nesfatin-1 regulates the phenotypic switching of CCSMCs through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.

In recent years, there has been a growing body of research on the role of the star protein Nesfatin-1. Most of these studies have focused on the significant impact of Nesfatin-1 on improving diabetes and obesity [[30], [31], [32]]. Currently, there is a lack of research investigating the role of Nesfatin-1 in the treatment of T2DMED. Erectile dysfunction, as a complication of type 2 diabetes, is associated with type 2 diabetes but also has independent pathological mechanisms. Whether Nesfatin-1 can ameliorate T2DMED and the mechanisms involved present crucial scientific questions.This study employed a high-fat feeding approach to establish a type 2 diabetes mouse model, confirming the occurrence of T2DMED. Leveraging cell experiments to simulate the glucose and lipid metabolism microenvironment of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells in type 2 diabetes, Nesfatin-1 was introduced for intervention and investigation. The findings demonstrate that Nesfatin-1 not only improves T2DMED but also plays a crucial role in the phenotypic transformation of CCSMCs.

Our study is the first to investigate the novel peptide, Nesfatin-1, which not only improves the metabolic microenvironment but also significantly regulates the phenotypic conversion of CCSMCs in the treatment of T2DMED. Furthermore, our study is the first to delve into the PI3K/AKT/mTOR metabolic pathway, which regulates the phenotypic conversion of cavernous smooth muscle cells, elucidating the positive role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in improving T2DMED.

However, there are also limitations to our study. The erection of the penis is not only related to the cavernous smooth muscle cells but also to the endothelial cells of the cavernous sinus, which play an important role in the erection. Our study only describes the important role of Nesfatin-1 in regulating the phenotypic conversion of cavernous smooth muscle cells in the treatment of T2DMED, without further studying whether Nesfatin-1 has a similar effect on improving T2DMED in endothelial cells of the cavernous sinus. Additionally, due to technical limitations, we were unable to directly measure the blood pressure in the hearts of live mice and ensure that they lived for a sufficient period of time. Instead, we measured the tail artery pressure indirectly to reflect blood pressure. To some extent, there is a slight difference between the actual blood pressure of the entire mouse body and the measured value, although this difference does not affect the accuracy of the experiment.

In conclusion, our study found and confirmed that Nesfatin-1 could improve both glucose metabolism disorders and diabetic Ed in T2DMED mice, and this effect may be mediated by Nesfatin-1 promoting the transformation of corpus cavernosus smooth muscle cells to contractile phenotype through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. This study provides a new idea for the treatment of T2DMED.
